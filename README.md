# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This project uses data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. The data about six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) of 30 volunteers wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist were collected from the accelerometers.
